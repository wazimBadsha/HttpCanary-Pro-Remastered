### Plugin

HttpCanary supports the plugin function which can be used to implement customized interception processing on the data of captured packets. For example, the injector function is implemented by a plugin. Although we haven't released the plugin interface yet, we provide some built-in plugins in HttpCanary.


#### Plugin Management

You can enter Plugin Management Page from the sidebar. The page will displays all configured injector plugins, blocking plugins and other customized plugins.
